# How to Work With Polars LazyFrames

This folder contains completed notebooks and other files used in the Real Python tutorial [How to Work With Polars LazyFrames](https://realpython.com/polars-lazyframe/).

**The following files are included:**

- `tutorial_code.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook containing all the code used in the tutorial.
- `rides.parquet` contains taxi fare data used throughout the tutorial. [See below]
- `taxi_rides_nnGB.py` are a series of Python scripts that will generate a local copy of the `2021_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv` in different sizes. This is used to illustrate data streaming and is provided to help demonstrate streaming.
- `programming_languages.csv` is a small file used to illustrate the conversion between a DataFrame and a LazyFrame.
- `dataframe_timer.py` and `lazyframe_timer.py` are two scripts used to compare the speed differences when using both a DataFrame and LazyFrame to perform an analysis.
