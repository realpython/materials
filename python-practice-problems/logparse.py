"""log parser
Accepts a filename on the command line.  The file is a linux-like log file
from a system you are debugging.  Mixed in among the various statements are
messages indicating the state of the device.  They look like:
    Jul 11 16:11:51:490 [139681125603136] dut: Device State: ON
The device state message has many possible values, but this program only
cares about three: ON, OFF, and ERR.

Your program will parse the given log file and print out a report giving
how long the device was ON, and the time stamp of any ERR conditions.
