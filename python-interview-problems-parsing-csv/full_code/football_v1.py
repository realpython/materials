"""Find Minimum Goal Differential
Write a program that takes a filename on the command line and processes the
CSV contents. The contents will be a CSV file with end-of-season football
standings for the English Premier League.
Determine which team had the smallest goal differential that season.
The first line of the CSV file will be column headers, with each subsequent
line showing the data for one team:

    Team,Games,Wins,Losses,Draws,Goals For,Goals Against
    Arsenal,38,26,9,3,79,36

The columns labeled "Goals" and "Goals Allowed" contain the total number of
goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79
goals against opponents and had 36 goals scored against them).

Write a program to read the file, then print the name of the team with the
smallest difference in "for" and "against" goals.  Create unit tests with
Pytest to test your program.
