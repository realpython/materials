# Pydantic: Simplifying Data Validation in Python

Supporting code for the Real Python tutorial [Pydantic: Simplifying Data Validation in Python](https://realpython.com/pydantic-simplifying-data-validation-in-python/). 

To run the code in this tutorial, install Pydantic with its `email` dependency:

```console
(venv) $ python -m pip install "pydantic[email]"
```

Pydantic has a separate package for [settings management](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/), which you'll also cover in this tutorial. To install this, run the following command:

```console

```
