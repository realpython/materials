# So, one last time, step by step:
# 1. Create a link to redirect the user to for authentication:
link = create_oauth_link()
print(f"Follow the link to start the authentication with GitHub: {link}")

# 2. Paste the code you got from GitHub after authenticating
code = input("GitHub code: ")

# 3. Exchange that code with an access token
access_token = exchange_code_for_access_token(code)
print(f"Exchanged code {code} with access token: {access_token}")

# 4. Fetch user information
print_user_info(access_token=access_token)
