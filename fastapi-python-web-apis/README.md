# A Close Look at a FastAPI Example Application

This repository contains code snippets discussed in the associated tutorial on [A Close Look at a FastAPI Example Application](https://realpython.com/fastapi-python-web-apis/).

## Installation

The recommended way to install FastAPI is with the `[standard]` extra dependencies. This ensures you get all the tools you need for developing an API without having to hunt down additional packages later:

```console
$ python -m pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

The quotes around `"fastapi[standard]"` ensure the command works correctly across different [terminals](https://realpython.com/terminal-commands/) and operating systems. With the command above you install several useful packages, including the [FastAPI CLI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/) and [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), an ASGI server for running your application.

You can also use the `requirements.txt` file in this folder and run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the standard dependencies of FastAPI.
